# ⚡ JavaScript 32 Exercises

A complete, fast-paced, slightly sarcastic journey through modern JavaScript — built across **32 hands-on exercises and mini-projects**.

This repository is designed for anyone who wants to **master JavaScript by actually writing JavaScript**, not reading manuals.  
Everything is **clean**, **progressive**, and **fully executable**.  
Every folder contains an **HTML + CSS + JS setup**, and every script includes **comments that teach, not ramble**.

## 📘 Overview

**Author:** Tezas  
**Project Type:** Educational (Free & Open Source)  
**Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)  
**Total Exercises:** 32  
**Goal:** From console logs to full browser apps with DOM events, OOP, Fetch API, localStorage, and UI logic

## 🧩 Exercise Structure

Each exercise lives in its own folder:

```
ex001/
 └── index.html
 └── script.js
 └── style.css (if needed)
```

Nothing depends on anything else — every folder is a mini-project on its own.

## 🙌 Acknowledgment

This JavaScript project follows a simple truth: someone has to teach you the fundamentals before you can build anything that actually works.

Credit goes to **Michail Kasapoglou**, whose teaching approach built the foundation that made this entire JS exercise series possible. The lessons here are rewritten and adapted in my own style, but the mindset and structure come from his guidance.

Thumbs up. 👍
