⚡ JavaScript 32 Exercises

A full collection of practical JS lessons — minimal, modular, and slightly sarcastic.

This repository contains 32 progressively structured JavaScript exercises, each designed to teach one concept at a time without wasting the student’s time (or sanity).
Every exercise is self-contained, runnable, and includes clean comments, deadpan humor, and zero unnecessary complexity.

📘 Overview

Author: Tezas
Project Type: Educational / Hands-On
Language: JavaScript (ES6+)
Total Exercises: 32
Goal: Build solid JS foundations through real, working mini-projects.

🧩 Exercise Structure

Each exercise lives in its own folder:

ex001_ConsoleBasics/
ex002_Variables/
ex003_Arithmetic/
...
ex032_Tracalorie2.0/


Inside each folder you will always find:

index.html
script.js
style.css   (only where needed)


Every file is clean, readable, and includes comments that explain why, not only what.
