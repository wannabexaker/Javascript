⚡ JavaScript 32 Exercises

A complete, fast-paced, slightly sarcastic journey through modern JavaScript — built across 32 hands-on exercises and mini-projects.

This repository is designed for anyone who wants to master JavaScript by actually writing JavaScript, not reading manuals.
Everything is clean, progressive, and fully executable.
Every folder contains an HTML + CSS + JS setup, and every script includes comments that teach, not ramble.

📘 Overview

Author: Tezas
Project Type: Educational (Free & Open Source)
Language: JavaScript (ES6+)
Total Exercises: 32
Goal: From console logs to full browser apps with DOM events, OOP, Fetch API, localStorage, and UI logic

🧩 Exercise Structure

Each exercise lives in its own folder:

ex001/
 └── index.html
 └── script.js
 └── style.css (if needed)


Nothing depends on anything else — every folder is a mini-project on its own.

Decided that learning JavaScript should be zero bullshit, structured, and a little bit funny.
